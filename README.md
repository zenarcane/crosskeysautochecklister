Autotracking crosskeys checklister for item caves and manual connector tracking
Original item cave checklist by Marcnificent
Checklister by StructuralMike
Autotracking code by BigDunka

Modified Checklister and Autotracking code to add autotracking to item caves for Crosskeys.  This will only mark off item caves, which is legal under ALttPR ruleset.  Connector entrances/exits are there for convenience marking to know what connectors are left.

Known issues that may (?) be able to be resolved:
Manually tracking an item cave to the off state and then picking up the item will turn the check back on
