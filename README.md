Autotracking crosskeys checklister for item caves and manual connector tracking <br>
Original item cave checklist by Marcnificent <br>
Checklister by StructuralMike <br>
Autotracking code by BigDunka<br> <br>

Modified Checklister and Autotracking code to add autotracking to item caves for Crosskeys.  This will only mark off item caves, which is legal under ALttPR ruleset.  Connector entrances/exits are there for convenience marking to know what connectors are left. <br><br>

How to use:<br>

Download checklister_v2.html and autot2.js <br>
Keep them in the same folder<br>
Run SNI (Unsure if QUSB2SNES works as I only use SNI)<br>
Run checklister_v2.html - resize as necessary<br><br>

Known issues that may (?) be able to be resolved:<br><br>

Manually tracking an item cave to the off state and then picking up the item will turn the check back on
