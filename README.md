Autotracking crosskeys checklister for item caves and manual connector tracking
Original item cave checklist by Marcnificent
Checklister by StructuralMike
Autotracking code by BigDunka

Modified Checklister and Autotracking code to add autotracking to item caves for Crosskeys.  This will only mark off item caves, which is legal under ALttPR ruleset.  Connector entrances/exits are there for convenience marking to know what connectors are left.

Due to a bug that I'm incapable of fixing (I don't program, I just stuffed this together), multi item caves are split out - hype npc vs back 4, blind bomb wall vs 4, kak well bomb wall vs. 4, paradox 2 and paradox 5, etc. 
The autotracking would break if you picked 1 chest but not the rest, so they are split to alleviate that
This has the unfortunate side effect of messing up the aesthetics StructuralMike set up, but that's how things go
